\f0\b \ul DATA CONCLUSIONS:\

\f1\b0 \ulnone - \'93test1_prtlab_freeze.ino\'94 can\'92t calculate inward flow. \
- \'93test1_prtlab_freeze.ino\'94 also was not sensitive to detecting inward flow.\
- The Arduino program was less accurate in FEV6 with slower flow rate.\
- \'93                 \'93 was very accurate and within acceptable range for faster flow rates.\
- *** raw data was lost on the terminal for the first 
\f2\i\b <2.3 L injected> 
\f1\i0\b0 test, but the printed calculations should still reflect calculations of the entire data set.\
\

\f0\b \ul PROJECT CONCLUSIONS:\

\f1\b0 \ulnone - Need to possible add zeroing function button, which allows user to zero the flow of device manually for any environment. The hospital spirometer can do this.\
- Need to make the data acquisition continuous so that user dictates when it will begin taking and stoping DAQ (possible 15 - 30 seconds).\
- Need to create calibration similar to their spirometer\'92s, where it plots Liters vs. time using a 3-L syringe to inject and suck 3-L of air at differing rates. the curves should all plateau at 3 liters.\
- Need to make compatible with inhalation.\
